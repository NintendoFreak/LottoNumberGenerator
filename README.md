# LottoNumberGenerator

Made in Raptor. (I wouldn't say "written"). Uses current Powerball and Mega Millions numbers as of July 20, 2019.

The program will ask you how many Powerball and MegaMillions results you want. It doesn't ask IF you want results - if you don't want them, you type in 0. Otherwise it'll just keep asking.

I just banged this out because I was bored.

I think you need all the other crap that goes with it to make it work right.
